                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4 style="color:white;">Core Message</h4>
                    <p>Zip's 50 AI agents are impressive for automating tasks, but tasks aren't intelligence. They accelerate intake-to-PO but are blind to what happens before intake (vendor risk screening) and after the PO (contract performance, compliance monitoring). While Zip speeds up buying, we ensure you're buying from the right vendors, with the right terms, at the right risk level. It's the difference between a faster process and a smarter ecosystem.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>The Pre-Intake Intelligence Gap</h4>
                    <p>"Zip starts when someone wants to buy. We start before they even know a vendor exists‚Äîpre-screening and risk-assessing. By the time Zip's intake form opens, we've already determined if the vendor should even be considered."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>The Post-Purchase Blindness</h4>
                    <p>"Zip's AI gets the PO approved. Then what? They don't monitor contract compliance, catch auto-renewals, or flag risk changes. Their intelligence ends at purchase. Ours continues through the entire vendor lifecycle."</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>The LuminIQ Advantage</h4>
                    <p>"Their 50 agents do 50 tasks. Our one intelligence layer (LuminIQ) connects risk to contracts to spend to performance. It's not about task automation - it's about relationship intelligence that flows through every vendor decision."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>Specific Counter: "We need Zip's AI-powered procurement"</h4>
                    <p>"Their AI speeds up forms and approvals. Our AI prevents risk and optimizes spend. Which delivers more value: saving 10 minutes on intake or preventing a $500K compliance breach? Both use AI, but for fundamentally different purposes."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>Specific Counter: "Zip is 'Built for NetSuite'"</h4>
                    <p>"So are we‚Äîplus we're built for the entire ecosystem. Zip talks to NetSuite for POs. We talk to NetSuite for spend data, Tipalti for payment intelligence, and Airbase for expense patterns to create one vendor command center, not just another intake tool."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>The Power Statement</h4>
                    <p>"Zip is racing to make procurement faster. We're focused on making vendor management smarter. They're building a highway for purchase orders; we're building the intelligence that prevents you from driving off a cliff."</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="coupa" class="tab-content card">
                 <h3 class="card-title">vs. Coupa</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4 style="color:white;">Core Message</h4>
                    <p>Coupa's $8T spending data is impressive, but it can't read YOUR contracts, assess YOUR vendor risks, or understand YOUR compliance requirements. They're built for Fortune 500 procurement departments with armies of analysts. We're built for teams who need vendor intelligence today, not after a 12-month implementation. While Coupa forces you to adapt to their rigid processes, we adapt to yours - going live in 4-6 weeks and connecting directly to your NetSuite instance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>The David vs. Goliath Positioning</h4>
                    <p>"Coupa is the SAP of procurement - powerful but overwhelming. We're the platform that actually gets adopted because business users can start using it immediately without a PhD in procurement."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>The Contract Intelligence Gap</h4>
                    <p>"Coupa can tell you the average price for office supplies across their network. But can they tell you that YOUR specific contract with YOUR supplier has a 30-day out clause, volume discounts at $50K, and auto-renewal in 23 days? That's the intelligence that actually matters."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>The Risk Blindness Reality</h4>
                    <p>"Coupa's community intelligence tells you average payment terms. Our LuminIQ tells you this specific vendor just failed a security audit, has 3 compliance violations, and their financial stability score dropped 20 points. Which intelligence protects your business?"</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>The Implementation Truth</h4>
                    <p>"Coupa's average implementation is 9-12 months and costs more than our entire annual license. By the time they're live, we've already delivered 8 months of ROI and prevented multiple compliance issues."</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>Specific Counter: "Coupa is the market leader"</h4>
                    <p>"Absolutely - for Fortune 500 companies with dedicated procurement teams and million-dollar implementation budgets. But for organizations that need results this quarter, not next year, we deliver faster time-to-value with better user adoption."</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>The Power Statement</h4>
                    <p>"Coupa is building the 'operating system for business spend' - a massive transformation project. We're delivering 'vendor intelligence that works tomorrow' - practical results without the revolution."</p>
                </div>

                     <p><strong>Opening:</strong> "It's great that you're leveraging SuiteProcurement as your foundation. How are you bringing intelligence around vendor risk and contracts into that process?"</p>
                    <p><strong>Value Prop:</strong> "SuiteProcurement is fantastic for handling transactions. We provide the intelligence layer on top‚Äîrisk, contracts, and compliance‚Äîto ensure those transactions are safe and smart. It's how you complete the picture."</p>

                <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>For Tipalti & Airbase Users</h4>
                    <p><strong>Opening:</strong> "Tipalti/Airbase is excellent for payments/spend - we're partners. How are you ensuring those efficient transactions go to compliant, low-risk vendors?"</p>
                    <p><strong>Value Prop:</strong> "They ensure vendors get paid accurately and efficiently. We ensure you're paying the RIGHT vendors for the RIGHT reasons by adding risk and contract intelligence upfront."</p>

                    <h4>vs. CLM-only (Icertis, Ironclad)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Counter:</strong> "Icertis and Ironclad excel at contract authoring, but contracts don't exist in a vacuum. We're the only platform where every contract is automatically enriched with real-time vendor risk intelligence and connected to actual spend data from NetSuite. While they perfect the document, we protect the business."</p>

                 <div class="battlecard-detail">
                    <h4>vs. Risk-only (OneTrust, Aravo)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Counter:</strong> "OneTrust and Aravo are excellent at collecting risk data, but data without action is just expensive paperwork. We make risk intelligence actionable by embedding it directly into procurement workflows‚Äîscreening vendors before onboarding and blocking high-risk purchases before they happen. One platform, no duct tape."</p>
